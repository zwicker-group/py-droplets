Structure of the package
""""""""""""""""""""""""
The functionality of the :mod:`droplets` package is split into multiple modules.
In particular, we distinguish classes that deal with single droplets from those
classes that represent collections (emulsions).
The functions analyzing images are collected in a separate module.

Extending functionality
"""""""""""""""""""""""
All code is build on a modular basis, making it easy to introduce new classes
that integrate with the rest of the package. For instance, it is simple to
define a droplet class that stores additional information by subclassing
:class:`~droplets.droplets.SphericalDroplet`.


Coding style
""""""""""""
The coding style is enforced using `ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_, based on the
styles suggest by `isort <https://timothycrosley.github.io/isort/>`_ and
`black <https://black.readthedocs.io/>`_. Moreover, we use `Google Style docstrings
<https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings>`_,
which might be best `learned by example
<https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_.
The documentation, including the docstrings, are written using `reStructuredText
<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_, with examples in the
following `cheatsheet
<https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst>`_.
To ensure the integrity of the code, we also try to provide many test functions,
which are typically contained in separate modules in sub-packages called
:mod:`tests`.
These tests can be ran using scripts in the :file:`tests` subfolder in the root
folder.
This folder also contain a script :file:`tests_types.sh`, which uses :mod:`mypy`
to check the consistency of the python type annotations.
We use these type annotations for additional documentation and they have also
already been useful for finding some bugs.


Running unit tests
""""""""""""""""""
The :mod:`droplets` package contains several unit tests, typically contained in 
sub-module :mod:`tests` in the folder of a given module. These tests ensure that
basic functions work as expected, in particular when code is changed in future
versions. To run all tests, there are a few convenience scripts in the root
directory :file:`tests`. The most basic script is :file:`tests_run.sh`, which
uses :mod:`pytest` to run the tests in the sub-modules of the :mod:`droplets`
package. Clearly, the python package :mod:`pytest` needs to be installed. There
are also additional scripts that for instance run tests in parallel (need the
python package :mod:`pytest-xdist` installed), measure test coverage (need
package :mod:`pytest-cov` installed), and make simple performance measurements.
Moreover, there is a script :file:`test_types.sh`, which uses :mod:`mypy` to
check the consistency of the python type annotations and there is a script
:file:`codestyle.sh`, which checks the coding style.

Before committing a change to the code repository, it is good practice to run
the tests, check the type annotations, and the coding style with the scripts
described above.
